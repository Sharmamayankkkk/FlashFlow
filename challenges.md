## Technical Challenges

A primary challenge was ensuring the atomicity of the flash loan. The entire sequence—borrowing, executing a strategy, and repaying the loan—must occur within a single blockchain transaction. Crafting the AI prompt to generate robust and gas-efficient smart contract logic that handles all these steps correctly was complex. Any error in the generated code could lead to the transaction failing and the loan not being repaid, which, while safe due to automatic reversion, is not a successful outcome.

Another hurdle was creating a realistic, real-time simulation of the transaction. To provide users with an accurate viability assessment, the simulation needs to account for rapidly changing market conditions, such as price slippage on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and network gas fees. This required the AI model to act as a sophisticated analyst, capable of inferring these risks from the code and providing a reasonable profit-and-loss projection without actually forking the blockchain state.
